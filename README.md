## Overview

Add unit built for mobiles with RWD rules, SwiperJS for gallery, and GSAP for smooth animations.
Project includes swipe gallery, orientation lock functionality, event tracking.
The app is devided into 3 scenes - intro, gallery and video.
- Intro - lasts 8 seconds - I had no idea for it so it has counter placeholder
- Gallery - swipe left to right, right to left, 1 per mobile view, 3 for desktop view, fancy pulsing button
- Video - display in one of the corner, depends on gallery item you clicked  
Gallery module is a bit mess but commented.

Remember to switch to mobile in devtools so orientation lock works.
